# Password-Generator

## Description

The following project is a random password generator written and developed using JavaScript. There are a number of prompts which the user will be required to follow through to generate a desired password. The first prompt will ask the user to input a desired character length between 10-64 characters. This is to be followed by a second prompt asking if the user wishes to have capital letters included in the outcome. Each time a prompt is returned with either true or false the user input is saved and a password is eventually generated displaying an outcome based off of the user input on each prompt. 

## Task 

Generate a random password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

* Length of password:
* At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
* Character types:
* Lowercase
* Uppercase
* Numeric
* Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

The code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Challenges

* Validating users input choices. 
* Selecting elements from the different array options.
* Variable naming
* Determining which loop to use and where.

## Things I learned 
* How to use the prompts, confirm and alerts
* Nesting functions
* The random functions
* How to declare and use variables globally and locally.
* How to apply loops in validation
